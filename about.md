I, Jack Xu, am a software developer, mostly using Ruby currently. I have contributed to Rails and Rack and I have a few gems of my own. (check out my github repos)

I love the art of crafting readable and maintainable code. I believe the code says a lot about the programmer himself or herself, so I take it very personally. I remember that my graduate school professor once commented "Chemistry is more an art than science" (I was a Chemistry major then and decided not to pursue a Ph.D. in Organic Chemistry). I feel that writing code is also more an art than science, that it takes an acute sensitivity or Coding Quotient (CQ) to write it well.

For the past few years, I have worked a lot in the world of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) or MicroServices Architecture. I find it very challenging and at the same time decidedly rewarding to resolve the problems working with these types of software systems.

I have also been working with functional programming languages, such as Elixir and Scala, and Clojure.

Any questions/suggestions: I can be reached at jackxxu at gmail.
